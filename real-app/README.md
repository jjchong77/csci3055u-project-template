This folder contains the code of a reasonably real application 
implemented in the language.

This application allows for the user to store data about Students (name, mark, and student ID), and one Class they attend (storing the class's name, course code, and a vector of students.)

It can print out the classes, listing the average mark and ratio of students that are passing the course.
