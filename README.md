## About the syntax

> _give some code snippet of the language_

*Let form*

```clojure
(let [x 10
      y 20]
  (+ x y))
```

## About the tools

> _Rustup, the installer, comes packaged with Cargo. Similar to Lein, Cargo can automatically create projects and run them from a src folder._.

## About the standard library

> _Give some examples of the functions and data structures
> offered by the standard library_.

## About open source library

> _Describe at least one contribution by the open source
community written in the language._

# Analysis of the language

> _

1.	The style of programming supported by the language: functional vs procedural programming	
2.	The ability to perform meta-programming such as macros
3.	Symbol resolution and its support for closure
4.	Scoping rules supported by the language: lexical vs dynamic scoping
5.	Functional programming constructs either as part of the language or supported by the standard library of the runtime.
6.	Its type system: static vs dynamic types
7.	Strengths and weaknesses of the language
