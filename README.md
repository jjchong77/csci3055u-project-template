*Let form*

```clojure
(let [x 10
      y 20]
  (+ x y))
```

## About the tools

> _Rustup, the installer, automatically installs a package manager known as Cargo. Similar to Lein, Cargo can automatically create projects and run them either from a file located in the src folder, or from the directory through the command ```cargo run```. It does require you to have the Visual Basic Studio tools for C installed._.

community written in the language._
The open source library function for Rust is located on https://crates.io/. For the purpose of this assignmen, I opted to use the 
# Analysis of the language

> _
Rust is a language that has some support for functional programming.
It allows the user to utilize macros for meta programming - writing code that writes more code.

3.	Symbol resolution and its support for closure
4.	Scoping rules supported by the language: lexical vs dynamic scoping
5.	Functional programming constructs either as part of the language or supported by the standard library of the runtime.
Rust has a strongly static type system. (it also supports type inference. This means that even if you don't declare the type, it will assign a type based off how the variable is used.)
7.	Strengths and weaknesses of the language
Rust's main focus is on being memory safe - it avoids memory leaks and such.
